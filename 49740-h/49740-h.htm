<span class="i0">ALL her youth is gone, her beautiful youth outworn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daughter of tarn and tor, the moors that were once her home<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Where she was wont to roam.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All her hounds are dead, her beautiful hounds are dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That paced beside the hoofs of her high and nimble horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or streaked in lean pursuit of the tawny hare that fled<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Out of the yellow gorse.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All her lovers have passed, her beautiful lovers have passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young and eager men that fought for her arrogant hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the only voice which endures to mourn for her at the last<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Is the voice of the lonely land.<br /></span>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">HE sat among the shadows lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard the careless voice speak on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of life when he was gone from home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of days that he had made his own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Familiar schemes that he had known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dates that he had cherished most<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As star-points in the year to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he was suddenly alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thinking (not bitterly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with a grave regret) that he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was in that room a ghost.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He sat among the shades apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The careless voice he scarcely heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that arrested hour there stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shy birds of beauty in his heart.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The clouds of March he would not see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the sky race royally,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet the drift of daffodil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He planted with so glad a hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet the loveliness he planned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For summer’s sequence to fulfil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor trace upon the hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The annual waking of the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor meditative stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To watch the turning of the mill.<a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He would not pause above the Weald<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With twilight falling dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mark the chequer-board of field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water gleaming like a shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oast-house in the elms concealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor see, from heaven’s chalice-rim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vintaged sunset brim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet the high, suspended star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hanging eternally afar.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">These things would be, but not for him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At summer noon he would not lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One with his cutter’s rise and dip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free with the wind and sea and sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watch the dappled waves go by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea-gulls scream and slip;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White sails, white birds, white clouds, white foam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White cliffs that curled the love of home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around him like a whip....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would not see that summer noon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fade into dusk from light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While he on shifting waters bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sailed idly on, beneath the moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Climbing the dome of night.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This was his dream of happy things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he had loved through many springs,<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never more might know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But man must pass the shrouded gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Companioned by his secret fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he must lonely go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none can help or understand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For other men may touch his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But none the soul below.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">THEY roll, clan by clan, kin by kin, on wide orderly roads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burghers and citizens all, in a stately procession,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driving before them the wealth of their worldly possession,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cattle, and horses, and pack-mules with sumptuous loads.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In velvet and fur and fat pearls,&mdash;rich lustre and sheen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paunches and plenty, and fatuous voices contented<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Counting their gain, and their women all jewelled and scented<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiling false smiles with the little sharp word in between.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But those in the by-paths of vagrancy, star-gazers, they,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ragged and feckless and young, with no thought but their singing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Derisive of gain, and light as the bird in its winging,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stopping to kiss or to frolic, the simple and gay,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">God’s fools,&mdash;the belovèd of God who made them and the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gipsies and wastrels of life, the heedless of warning,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Clang as of brass, an uproar that will not cease.<br /></span>

<h3>ON THE STATUE OF A VESTAL VIRGIN BY TOMA ROSANDIĆ</h3>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">HOW slender, simple, shy, divinely chaste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wilting stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her suppleness at pause, by leisure graced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In robes archaic by the chisel woo’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That smoothly flowed around her waist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all her figure traced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at her feet in fluid ripples broke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Vestal virgin! but she rather seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Hamadryad of the sculpted oak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since in that oaken raiment she for ever dreamed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One finger to her lips she raised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turned her dubious glances wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one who forward to the future gazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But her reluctant body swerved away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one who held her bounty back with pride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Forbear!” her hesitation seemed to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While her exulting soul for instant capture cried.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And she was ageless; leisure unperturbed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay like a light across her brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sanctified her vow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that uplifted hand from its austerity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another spirit stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spirit of grace, spirit of fantasy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wayward spirit of the pagan tree.<a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Had she stood dreaming by the water’s verge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her branches mirrored in the forest pool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where plashing sunlight flickered and was cool?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did she so stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the sculptor with his mortal hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Summoned the mortal maiden to emerge?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And did she open eyes upon a place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All pied and jewelled with the flowers wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With king-cups and the pretty daisy mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With periwinkle sulking like a child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And little orchis with his puckered face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And campion too?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did these, when first they saw her, race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around her feet like tiny rivulets?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">THERE travelled north from Kurdistan along the lone Siberian trails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A merchant with his caravan and Eastern barter in his bales.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rode ahead, he rode apart, the city of Irkutsk his goal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his lean Circassian foal, and after came the lumbering cart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With creaking wheel, deliberate spoke, and water-bullocks in the yoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after these in single string the boorish camels following,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slouching with high unwieldy packs like howdahs piled upon their backs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With slaver hanging from their lips and hatred worming in their brain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They slouched beneath their drivers’ whips across the white and mournful plain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The merchant riding on alone saw not the white incessant snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He only saw the metal’s glow, the colour of the precious stone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lingered on the merchandise that he had brought from Kurdistan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turned, and swept his caravan with doting and voluptuous eyes,<a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there were choice Bokhara rugs, and daggers with Damascus blade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hafts of turquoise-studded jade, and phials rich with scented drugs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Koràns inscribed on ass’s skin, and bales of silk from Temesvàr,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And silver ear-rings beaten thin, and bargains from the cool bazaar.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He felt the gold already pouched, he crooned to it with horrid love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As still the camels onward slouched with hatred of the men that drove.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For thirty days the caravan trailed on behind the merchant’s foal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through Persia and through Turkestan, the city of Irkutsk their goal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They passed the fruitful hill-girt lands where dwelt the fair-skinned Grecian race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And came into the wilder place, and sighted vagrant Cossack bands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wandered with their flocks and herds, and trafficked with the train of Kurds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They stirred the ghost of Tamerlane, who swept that way with Tartar hordes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ghosts of dead barbarian lords, the Asiatic hurricane;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They crossed the mighty road that runs from Moscow through to China’s wall,<a name="page_083" id="page_083"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trod the path of nomad Huns and knew Siberia’s white pall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When fields of Persian asphodel were visions of a distant day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And boundless snow around them lay, and noiseless snow for ever fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where soon the fleeting day was done, and on the hard horizon low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They saw the scarlet ball of sun divided by the ridge of snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sink down in skies incarnadine; and still with their disjointed gait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nursing their malignant hate, the camels kept unbroken line.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When yet a hundred miles or more stretched out between them and their goal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The merchant riding on before drew rein on his Circassian foal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called a halt with lifted hand as he had done unfailingly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each night since the monotony began with that unvaried land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dusk was suddenly alive as shouting voices passed the word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the drowsy train was stirred with movement like a shaken hive.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The master merchant stiff from cramp was calling for his saddle flask,<a name="page_084" id="page_084"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As each to his accustomed task ran swiftly in the growing camp.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tent like an inverted bell, all scarlet with the dyes of Tyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was lifted rapidly and well, and like a torch the kindled fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destroyed the night with leaping tongue, and in a circle round the glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men shovelled back the melting snow, and skins and Khelim rugs were flung&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unforgotten were the needs of water-bullocks standing by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose brows are stained with orange dye, whose horns are looped with turquoise beads.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pariah dogs that slink and prowl secured their meat with furtive growl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one by one the camels bent complaining to their warty knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grumbled at the men that went to loose their girths and give them ease.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The merchant brooded silently on avaricious visions bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And listened to the revelry his men were making in the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For one, a young and favourite Kurd, a mongrel child of the bazaar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose voice was like a singing bird, was striking on a harsh guitar<a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a>&mdash;<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The cold moon rose remotely higher, insensibly the voices hushed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men with wine and laughter flushed were sleeping all around the fire,<a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till one alone sat on erect, his ready gun across his knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sentry of the night elect, guardian of sleeping destinies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The water-bullocks lay as dead; the dogs drew near with noiseless tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And huddled in a loose-limbed heap beside the fire, and through their sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They twitched at some remembered hunt; the merchant in his sheepskin rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the tent saw dreams of gold; the camels with uneasy grunt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quake of their distorted backs slept on with loathing by their packs.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At dawn the weary sentry rose to throw some brushwood on the flames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called on his comrades by their names, and turned to greet the endless snows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then from his astonished lips a cry of unbelieving rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the men towards him sprang, the camel drivers with their whips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bullock driver with his yoke, and gazed in loud bewilderment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till slowly in his fur-lined cloak the merchant issued from his tent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he too started at the sight and clamoured with his clamorous men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swore he could not see aright, and rubbed his eyes and stared again;<a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The camels came with lurching tread and stood in loose fantastic ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With necks outstretched and swaying head and mouths all slackly slobbering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drew from some unclean recess within their body’s secret lair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bladder smeared with filthiness that bubbled on the morning air.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For there upon the shining plain a city radiantly lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All coloured in the rising day, amid the snow a jewelled stain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her walls a spacious gate gave entrance to a varied stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of folk that went incorporate like figures in a silent dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And high above the roofs arose, more coloured for the hueless snows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The domes of churches, bronze and green, like peacocks in their painted sheen.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The merchant, with a trembling hand extended far, extended wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against illusion’s fairyland, at length articulately cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Irkutsk! but twice a hundred miles remained of weary pilgrimage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before we hoped with happy smiles to reach our final anchorage.<a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But look again. That rosy tower that rises like a tulip straight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the walls beside the gate, a balanced plume, a springing flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pointed with a lance-like spire of bronze, was fifty years ago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;A boy, I saw it standing so,&mdash;demolished and destroyed by fire.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And one, a venerable Kurd, took up again the fallen word:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I travelled both as boy and man between Irkutsk and Kurdistan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never since my beard was grown saw I that inn beside the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith the Council made away, full fifty counted years aflown.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They gazed upon the marvel long, the spectre city wonderful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the youth who made the song cried out, “We grow too fanciful.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Irkutsk with roofs of coloured tiles lies distant twice a hundred miles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this, a city of the shades, a rainbow of the echoing air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fair as false, and false as fair, already into nothing fades.”<a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And like a bubble, like the mist that in the valley faintly swirls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like orient sheen on sulky pearls, like hills remotely amethyst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like colours on Phœnician glass, like plumage on the ‘fisher’s wing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like music on the breath of spring, they saw the vision lift and pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till only white unbroken snow stretched out before the caravan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bewildered heart of man truth from delusion could not know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all the long laborious train moved slowly on its course again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the snow unbroken, white, and nursing each his private creed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The merchant his illusive greed, the camels their illusive spite.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When for’ard the crew, caps tilted over eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay heaped on deck; slept; murmured; smoked; threw dice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sleepy summer days; the summer nights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The coast pricked out with rings of harbour-lights),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The motionless nights, the vaulted nights of June<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When high in the cordage drifts the entangled moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blocks go knocking, and the sheets go slapping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lazy swells against the sides come lapping;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And summer mornings off red Devon rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint inland bells at dawn and crowing cocks.<a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Shared swifter days, when headlands into ken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trod grandly; threatened; and were lost again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old fangs along the battlemented coast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And followed still my ship, when winds were most<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night-purified, and, lying steeply over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She fled the wind as flees a girl her lover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quickened by that pursuit for which she fretted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her temper by the contest proved and whetted;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild stars swept overhead; her lofty spars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reared to a ragged heaven sown with stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As leaping out from narrow English ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She faced the roll of long Atlantic seas;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her captain then was I, I was her crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mind that laid her course, the wake she drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waves that rose against her bows, the gales,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, I was more: I was her very sails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rounded before the wind, her eager keel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her straining mast-heads, her responsive wheel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her pennon stiffened like a swallow’s wing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, I was all her slope and speed and swing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether by yellow lemons and blue sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She dawdled through the isles off Thessaly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or saw the palms like sheaves of scimitars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On desert’s verge below the sunset bars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or passed the girdle of the planet where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Southern Cross looks over to the Bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strayed, cool Northerner beneath strange skies,<a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flouting the lure of tropic estuaries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down that long coast, and saw Magellan’s Clouds arise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And some that beat up Channel homeward-bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I watched, and wondered what they might have found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What alien ports enriched their teeming hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With crates of fruit or bars of unwrought gold?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought how London clerks with paper-clips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had filed the bills of lading of those ships,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clerks that had never seen the embattled sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wrote down jettison and barratry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perils, Adventures, and the Act of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Having no vision of such wrath flung broad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrote down with weary and accustomed pen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The classic dangers of sea-faring men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrote “Restraint of Princes,” and “the acts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the King’s Enemies,” as vacant facts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blind to the ambushed seas, the encircling roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of angry nations foaming into war.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I saw a ship sailing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No other ship in sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steadily she was sailing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although the wind fell light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although the wind was failing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still she kept sailing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No hand there that steered her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No wind that strained her sheet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as I gazed I feared her:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why should she be so fleet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since no crew’s chanty cheered her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no wind neared her?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her strange sure motion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carried her swiftly past;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the rim of ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I watched her dip her mast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still no wind blew in motion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the ocean.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Furs, spices, oranges, and slaves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High galleys waited, runged with tiers of oars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rippled their reflection in the waves.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bearded and serge-clad merchants, tightly-lipped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They stood in groups along the foreign quays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching the cargo shipped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By coloured sons of Asia; these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Groaned loaded up the planks, and rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their burdens down the hold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And back the planks unburdened nimbly tripped,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yawning amongst the pigeons’ sleek content,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opened one crafty, long, Mongolian eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw the slim Italian passing by<a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With soft-foot tread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the mosque, but never raised his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slipped his cedar beads, and never stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the quick patter of the coins he heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall in a handful mixed of maize and rice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flung to the pigeons, coins that were his price.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
